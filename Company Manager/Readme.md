# How to run 
Administrator login credentials:

- username: Admin 

- password: admin

If by some kind of accident you delete Admin this shouldnt happen (I tried to think of 
almost every way of how it could be deleted), than there is a backdoor on line 20 in EmployeeHandling there is 
also a written guide on how to use it.

If by some kind of accident you would corrupt the .ser files it's good to clear both the employees.ser and projects.ser and do the step above. 

When you get to the employees tab in order to manipulate each user you have to click on the user in the ListView and your options will be shown the
same goes for the project tab.

If you clicked on some project in project listview there is a dropdown list where are the free unassigned employees shown if you select smbdy you can assign them.
When you want to unassign somebody just select them in the list of assigned employees and press unassign.

If there are some questions regarding on how to use the program the feel free to contact me at: p.koszorus27@gmail.com
